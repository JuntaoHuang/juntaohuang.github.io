I am an Assistant Professor at [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/cas/units/departments/mathematical-sciences/) at [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/). 

I received my Ph.D. in Applied Math in 2018 and dual Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Engineering Mechanics in 2013, all from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
Before joining UD, I was a visiting assistant professor at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/) from 2018 to 2022, followed by a faculty position at [Texas Tech University](https://www.ttu.edu/) from 2022 to 2025.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
